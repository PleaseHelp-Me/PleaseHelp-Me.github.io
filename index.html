                My life in my home country
            </h1>
            <p>
                I lost my family when I was a little kid. I was working at people's home just to let me stay at night
                under a roof and a little safe.
                Working and living homeless town to town until when I was 18 years old. Then I went to the army. I was 5
                years in the army and it was the best moment of my life that I had a place to stay and food
                until I lost my arm in a explosion and I could not stay in the army anymore.
            </p>

            <h1>
                Homeless, town to town, country to country, what a sad and small world
            </h1>
            <p>
                People laugh on me why I have torn clothes, why I am so thin, why I have black hairs, why I always walk
                around street to street, town to town ...
                No problem, I with a sad heart love to make people laugh on me. I love to see laugh and smile on each
                face in every person in the entire world. Let them laugh, if they have experienced a tiny piece of my
                problems then they had never laughed on me. I come to you with a big hope because I know that you are
                kindhearted enough to feel me and understand me.
            </p>

                About the writer of this website
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am Louis a student.
                When I met this man and heard his story, I cried a lot and started doing something for this kind man
                because the government does not do anything for him and I have just enough for myself. So, the only way
                that I
                could help this man is to ask help from you. <br>
                Thank you for helping him. God bless you!
            </p>
